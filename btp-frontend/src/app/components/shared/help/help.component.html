                Streams Tab : This tab is for adding any new streams in the institute.

                        The “+” button on the top of the table can be used to add a new branch and the delete button can be used to remove the branch.
                    
                Programs Tab : This tab is for adding any new programs within the provided streams. This tab requires 

                        Mapping to the roll.no of the students of that particular program. The “+” button on the top of the table can be used to add a new program and the delete 
                        button can be used to remove the program.

                Explanation:
	
                    Now let us consider that IIT Palakkad has four core streams
                        1. Computer Science and Engineering(CSE)
                        2. Electrical Engineering(EE)
                        3. Mechanical Engineering(ME)
                        4. Civil Engineering(CE)

                    The above four streams must be added one by one in the streams tab:

                    For CSE:  

                        name : Computer Science and Engineering
                        short :  CSE
                        Similarly add all the other streams.
                    

                    
                    Now these streams further contain many programs such as UG, PG etc. For now let us consider that there are only two programs UG and PG.
                    
                    These programs will have to be registered under the programs tab.
                        Click on the “+” button to add programs  and in the pop-up fill in the required details.
                        Example:
                            Let us consider the UG and PG programs must be added in the CSE stream.
                            Now click on “+” button, In the pop-up the fill the required details,
                            
                    For UG:

                        Name: UG-Computer Science and Engineering or any other suitable name.
                        Short: UG-CSE or any other suitable name. (allowed characters are letters, underscore and hyphen).
                        Map: This field needs a simple regex to identify the students of that particular program from their roll number.
                        Example:
                            For UG-CSE the current roll numbers are 111801***
                            So here the map would be 0|11
                            For UG-EE the current roll numbers are 121801***
                            So here the map would be 0|12
                        Split up of the map:
                        The numbers to the left of the pipe must tell the number of characters in the roll number before the occurrence of the unique pattern for that 
                        program.
                        For UG-CSE, UG-EE, UG-ME, UG-CE the roll numbers are 11…, 12…., 13…., 10… respectively the unique patterns are 11,12,13,10 respectively and the 
                        number of characters before that is 0 so the map for each program would be 0|11, 0|12, 0|13, 0|10 respectively.

                        Similarly the CSE program for PG can also be added.
